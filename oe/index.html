			<p>Purdue Society of Professional Engineers (PSPE) invites you to participate in the 96th Order of the Engineer Ceremony on Monday, April 22nd from 6:30pm-7:30pm in the WALC Hiler Theater by registering at this <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/gVrmwVrIrQWYiRvJ3">link</a>. The Order of the Engineer is a meaningful opportunity for graduating or already graduated engineering students to show pride and responsibility in their profession and includes taking an ethical oath called the Obligation of an Engineer.</p>

			<p>The Order of the Engineer was initiated to foster a spirit of pride and responsibility in the professional engineering community; to bridge the gap between training and experience; and to present to the public a visible symbol identifying a person as an engineer. The Ceremony includes taking an oath similar to the oath taken by medical professionals and sets forth an ethical code. The Obligation contains parts of the Canon of Ethics widely acknowledged by many major engineering societies. Initiates voluntarily pledge to uphold the standards and dignity of the engineering profession and to serve humanity by making the best use of Earth’s precious wealth.</p>

			<p>This semester’s keynote speaker is Dr. Mung Chiang, the John A. Edwardson Dean of the College of Engineering and the Roscoe H. George Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University. Dean Mung Chiang is an accomplished professor, researcher and engineer who looks forward to sharing his experiences and advice with our inductees.</p>

			<p>To participate in the event, there is a one-time $20 fee that covers the cost of participating in a short, but meaningful ceremony, where you will receive a stainless steel ring to be worn on the small finger of your working hand, and a certificate.</p>

			<p>Payments will be accepted at the PSPE office in HAMP 1250, or through Purdue’s BOSO online. If you do not know your ring size, you may come to the PSPE office during any of the office hours posted on our <a href="http://purduepspe.com/contact/">contact page</a> to measure your ring size. If you have additional questions or concerns, please feel free to contact PSPE with any questions at pspe@ecn.purdue.edu</p><br>

			<h3>History of the Order of the Engineer</h3><br>
			
			<p>The first ceremony was held on June 4, 1970 at Cleveland State University. Since then, similar ceremonies have been held across the United States at which graduate and registered engineers are invited to accept the Obligation of the Engineer and a stainless steel ring. The ceremonies are conducted by Links (local sections) of the Order.</p>

			<p>The Order is not a membership organization; there are never any meetings to attend or dues to pay. Instead, the Order fosters a unity of purpose and the honoring of one's pledge lifelong. The Obligation is a creed similar to the oath attributed to Hippocrates (460-377 B.C.) that is generally taken by medical graduates and which sets forth an ethical code. The Obligation likewise, contains parts of the Canon of Ethics of major engineering societies. Initiates, as they accept it voluntarily, pledge to uphold the standards and dignity of the engineering profession and to serve humanity by making the best use of Earth's precious wealth.</p>

			<p>The Obligation of the Order of the Engineer is similar to the Canadian "Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer" initiated there in 1926. It uses a wrought iron ring, conducts a secret ceremony, and administers an oath authorized by Rudyard Kipling. The extension of the Ritual outside Canada was prevented by copyright and other conflicting factors. The basic premise, however, was adapted for the creation of the Order of the Engineer in the United States in 1970.</p>
