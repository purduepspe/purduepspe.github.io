			<h1>History of the Research Roundtable</h1>
			<p>The Purdue Research Roundtable originally began as an idea between two friends within separate student organizations - Purdue Society of Professional Engineers and Tau Beta Pi Engineering Honors Society. As their connections grew, the idea expanded. In Fall 2011 it finally reached maturity, where it evolved into a real, sponsored event. The first Research Roundtable took place February 23rd, 2012 as part of Engineering Week (E-Week) for students within the College of Engineering as an opportunity to find research available on campus in the West Lafayette area. It began in Purdue's Memorial Union North Ballroom from 10 AM to 4 PM and succeeded in attracting 37 research groups and 280 students. Now, it has expanded to include agriculture, science, and technology students. Designed to connect students with a plethora of exciting research projects, the Purdue Research Roundtable brings together a multitude of groups and programs currently in progress at Purdue, functioning as a traditional career fair. Research groups or programs, will be present to show the research opportunities they have available for undergraduates and graduates. If you are looking to get involved with a research project, whether for tech elective credit, a summer fellowship, or internship, come to the Roundtable, and see what's available for you.</p>
