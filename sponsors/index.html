				<h3>Thank You!</h3>
				<p>Through donation of their resources, both corporate and private partners contribute to educational progress of students in groups like the <b>Purdue Society of Professional Engineers</b>. Not only do these resources aid in helping students to learn and grow, but they also play a role in fueling the development of tomorrow's leaders. As a small thank you to our friends, this page serves to acknowledge their generosity.</p>
				<h3>What We Offer Our Sponsors</h3>
				<p>Like most relationships in the professional world, there should be benefits for all parties involved. In keeping with this practice we offer all of our <b>PSPE</b> sponsors the opportunity to gain increased visibility within the Purdue community. The name of each of our sponsors will be placed on the <b>PSPE</b> website, and those that designate Research Roundtable or the Fundamentals of Engineering Exam as the destination for their funds will also receive further benefits as listed below.</p>

				<h4>Fundamentals of Engineering Exam Sponsorship</h4>
				<p><b>PSPE</b> is looking for a company to provide a scholarship to those taking the Fundamentals of Engineering exam, which is normally taken by seniors in their last semester of college. This exam provides a measure of student proficiency and is a first step to becoming a professional engineer.</p>
				<p>Students interested in receiving a scholarship for the fees associated with the exam would fill out an application, including their personal information, responses to questions (like why they want to become a professional engineer), and a resume for you to consider. Companies that have donated to this cause will be allowed to choose the top students, which will receive a scholarship to pay for exam fees.</p>
				<h3>Interested in Becoming a Corporate Sponsor?</h3>
				<p>For more information about how to become an official <b>PSPE Coroprate Sponsor</b> please do not hesitate to email us at <a href="mailto:pspe@ecn.purdue.edu">pspe@ecn.purdue.edu</a>. We are also open to suggestions of additional methods of donation. </p>
