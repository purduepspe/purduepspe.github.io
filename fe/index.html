					<h2 class="fe-subtitle">The first step to becoming a professional engineer is taking the fundamentals of engineering exam.</h2>

				<div class="gold">
					<h1 class="fe-title">What is the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) Exam?</h1>
					<p class="fe-content">The Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam is generally the first step in the process of becoming a professional licensed engineer (P.E.). It is designed for recent graduates and students who are close to finishing an undergraduate engineering degree from an EAC/ABET-accredited program. (NCEES)</p>
					<p class="fe-content">The second step to becoming a professional engineer is the Principles and Practice of Engineering (PE) exam. This exam can be taken after a minimum of four (4) years of engineering experience, occurring after the receipt of a BS in engineering from an accredited collegiate program. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="grey">
					<h1 class="fe-title">Why should I take the FE Exam?</h1>
					<p class="fe-content">In order to do engineering consulting work, the designation of professional engineer is required. This means you will have to have taken and passed the FE and PE exam. It is unlawful to tell the public you can perform independent engineering work in the form of consultation, investigation, evaluation or design of engineering works and systems without a PE license.</p>
					<p class="fe-content">An engineer is allowed to work for a company designing and manufacturing products without being a registered professional engineer. This is because product liability laws protect the public. However, if a company offers engineering services in any of the above mentioned categories, the person responsible for the work must be a registered engineer. If you work for such a company and you are not registered, the law says you must work under the supervision of a registered engineer.</p>
					<p class="fe-content">In addition to reasons regarding regulations surrounding the engineering industry, having a PE license is a valuable credential - an important thing in a competitive job market.</p>

					<h1 class="fe-title">How do I register for the FE Exam?</h1>
					<p class="fe-content">Students enrolled in an ABET-accredited engineering curriculum at Purdue may take the FE examination prior to the student's scheduled graduation. Students may take the FE only once using the student application. If you need to take the exam a second time, you must complete all of the Indiana state forms <br>

					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="grey">
					<h1 class="fe-title">Why should I take the exam before graduation?</h1>
					<p class="fe-content">The success rate of the exam is highest right before or after completing the Bachelors degree. Purdue engineering students, after studying the the FE Review Manual for 8 hours, have close to a 90% passing rate when all the engineering concepts are still fresh in their mind. The pass rate for those who take the exam in the first year after graduation is about 70%. The pass rate drops about 10% for every year you wait past the first year.</p>
					<p class="fe-content">You can take the exam in any semester, not just the final semester of senior year. Once registration is paid, you will have up to 1 year to take the exam. You wil be able to take the exam in any state as long as the test site is an approved site. Purdue has its own NCEES-approved Pearson VUE Testing Center (SCHL B-42)</p>
					<p class="fe-content">Anothe reason to take the exam while you are a senior is the simple application process. Just fill out a small form, mail it to ELSES, register online to take the exam and pay the fee. Results of the FE exam are typically available 7-10 days after you take the exam. However, you cannot request your actual FE Certificate until you have received your diploma and forwarded NCEES a copy.</p>
